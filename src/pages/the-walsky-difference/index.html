                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">For over 17 years, Walsky Investment Management has been helping individuals and families invest for the future by offering professional money management services that focuses on selecting individual stocks for our clients portfolios.  Our clients know what they own, why they own it and are kept informed whenever there are any changes in their portfolio.  Our clients meet with the person selecting these investments and have a one-on-one relationship with their portfolio manager.  This enables us to customize each clients portfolio to help each client plan for the future - whether it is saving for retirement, or buying a new home.  Unlike other investment firms that offer mutual funds, ETFs and a myriad of other non-investment related products, our focus is to be a traditional money management firm that is focused on investing for our clients.</p>
                    <p>At Walsky Investment Management we offer one-on-one service and work with with each client regularly to help them manage their investments.  Our clients meet with the person making the investment decisions in their portfolios along with a professional that is available to them to answer any question that they may have about their account.  It is a level of service that has become less common in the industry, but is found each and every day at Walsky Investment Management.</p>

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">Historically, investors have purchased stock with the expectation that a portion of a company's annual profits would be distributed to them as a return on investment. Typically, an established company will reinvest a portion of their earnings back into its business, repurchase some of its outstanding stock, and then will distribute the rest of the earnings to stockholders in the form of dividends.</p>
                    <p>Although many companies pay dividends, only a relatively small number of them have maintained dependable dividend growth. These are the equities we seek for our managed portfolios. Our view is that strong dividend growth stocks are long-term performance achievers with lower risk and volatility than non dividend-paying stocks. Dividends, we believe, are very important in the creation of wealth.</p>

                    <p>Walsky Investment Management, Inc. seeks out companies with strong dividend growth potential as the principal holdings of its managed portfolios. Most often, these companies have a history of dividend growth well in excess of the rate of inflation.</p>

                    <p>Our analysis has found that stocks with annual dividend increases not only hold up well during periods of volatility, but also act as a critical element of portfolio growth. </p>
