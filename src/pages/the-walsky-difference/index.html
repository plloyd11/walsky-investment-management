                        For over 23 years, Walsky Investment Management has been helping individuals and families invest
                        for the future by offering professional money management services that focus on selecting
                        individual stocks for our clients’ portfolios. Our clients know what they own, why they own it
                        and are kept informed of any changes in their portfolio. Our clients meet with the person
                        selecting these investments and have a one-on-one relationship with their portfolio manager.
                        This enables us to customize each client’s portfolio to help them plan for the future, whether
                        it is saving for retirement, or buying a new home. Unlike other investment firms that only offer
                        mutual funds, ETFs and a myriad of other non-investment related products, our focus is to be a
                        traditional money management firm that is focused on investing for our clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Walsky Investment Management, we offer one-on-one service and work with each client regularly
                        who work with a professional that is available to them to answer any question that they may have
                        about their account. It is a level of service that has become less common in the industry but is
                        found each and every day at Walsky Investment Management.

                            At Walsky Investment Management, Inc. our emphasis is investing for the long-term. We
                            realize the importance of dividends which provide earnings to stockholders and at the same
                            time minimizes downside risk. Our clients' portfolios consist mainly of common stocks of
                            companies with consistent dividend growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The remainder is invested in fixed income vehicles such as U.S. government bonds, corporate
                            bonds, certificates of deposit and money market funds. We believe that this investment style
                            affords lower risk without lowering the appreciation potential that makes common stocks
                            attractive.

                        <h2>How is Walsky different from a mutual fund?</h2>
                        <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">
                            Walsky Investment Management, Inc. is a registered investment advisory firm that creates
                            individual portfolios for each client based on his or her needs. A mutual fund, on the other
                            hand, is a portfolio of stocks in which a group of investors mutually invest and receive
                            shares of ownership. In addition, there are thousands of mutual funds whose management can
                            change over time. The fees that mutual funds charge have become a concern of investor groups
                            and investment journals that have noted the fees may be excessive. At Walsky, there is only
                            one fee and the fee is clearly identified to the client.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The portfolios that we create are diversified and include many sectors of the U.S. large-cap
                            equity market. Each portfolio differs in asset allocation based upon the client's
                            requirements and risk tolerance. By managing each portfolio independently, we ensure that
                            our clients have investments that are appropriate for them.

                    <p class="has-margin-bottom-md">
                        Historically, investors have purchased stock with the expectation that a portion of a company's
                        annual profits would be distributed to them as a return on investment. Typically, an established
                        company will reinvest a portion of their earnings back into its business, repurchase some of its
                        outstanding stock, and then will distribute the rest of the earnings to stockholders in the form
                        of dividends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although many companies pay dividends, only a relatively small number of them have maintained
                        dependable dividend growth. These are the equities we seek for our managed portfolios. Our view
                        is that strong dividend growth stocks are long-term performance achievers with lower risk and
                        volatility than non dividend-paying stocks. Dividends, we believe, are very important in the
                        creation of wealth.

                        Walsky Investment Management, Inc. seeks out companies with strong dividend growth potential as
                        the principal holdings of its managed portfolios. Most often, these companies have a history of
                        dividend growth well in excess of the rate of inflation.

                    <p>
                        Our analysis has found that stocks with annual dividend increases not only hold up well during
                        periods of volatility, but also act as a critical element of portfolio growth.

                    <p>
                        Historically, companies that increase their dividends regularly have been less volatile than the
                        overall market. They also produce products and services needed by the public, maintain a strong
                        presence in their markets, and are well managed.
