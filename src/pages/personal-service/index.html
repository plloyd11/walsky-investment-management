                    <p>
                        We believe that every investor should know why they are investing and how they are invested. One size does not fit all and each portfolio should
                        meet the unique needs of every client. Our clients are discerning investors who value the level of service that we provide and the ability to work
                        individually with the professionals that are responsible for managing their portfolio and making the investment decisions. Our quarterly
                        statements are concise and easy to read. We meet regularly with our clients to review their portfolio and to answer any questions that they may
                        have about their portfolio, the economy, or on occasion, the world in general! It is this exceptional level of service that we call “The Walsky
                        Way”.

                        Our firm is independent. We receive no remuneration of any kind from insurance companies, mutual funds, banks, or brokerage houses. Our clients
                        are likewise independent, and they want to be able to pick the best tax preparer, the best attorney, the best accountant and the best investment
                        advisor that will attend to their specific needs. At Walsky, we define personal service as having a one-on-one relationship with our clients.

                        Our quarterly statements are easy to read and understand. We review these statements with our clients to help answer any questions that they may
                        have and to assure that the information presented is helpful to them. This makes it easier for clients to understand their holdings and how their
                        portfolio is being managed.

                        There are no hidden fees at Walsky, nor do we charge a sales charge, wrap fees, or 12b-1 fees that many mutual funds charge. Our clients pay a %
                        fee based on their assets under management. We are happy to provide a schedule of our fees upon request.
