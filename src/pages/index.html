                    <h2>The Importance of Dividends</h2>
                    <p>
                        Historically, investors have purchased stock with the expectation that a portion of a company's annual profits would be distributed to them as a return on investment.
                        Typically, an established company will reinvest a portion of their earnings back into its business, repurchase some of its outstanding stock, and then will distribute the rest
                        of the earnings to stockholders in the form of dividends.
