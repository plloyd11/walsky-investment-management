                    <p>
                        Investing for the future requires a solid plan coupled with an investment style that will help
                        reach that goal. Since our founding, we have realized the value of dividend paying companies and
                        how they can be a good fit for most investors. While other investment styles have come in and
                        out of style, investing in companies with growing dividends remains a popular choice for those
                        investors that are seeking long-term growth while receiving a growing income.

                        Our research is as unique as our firm. Four times a year, our president, Craig Hafer, writes on
                        a topic that is relevant to today’s investors. These “newsletters” have fans across the county
                        and have earned the accolades of the WEEU radio listening audience, where Craig, also co-hosts
                        The Quarterly Report with Craig Hafer. One retired professional investor referred to our
                        newsletters as “reading a good profile in New Yorker magazine in a subject in which I am
                        conversant.”
