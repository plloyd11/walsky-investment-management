            Check out our winter 2020 quarterly newsletter, <span class="is-italic">Trump-onomics</span>,
            where Walsky President Craig Hafer discusses that while many people in the U.S. have benefited from free
            trade, many others have been hurt.

                        Investing for the future requires a solid plan coupled with an investment style that will help
                        reach that goal. Since our founding, we have realized the value of dividend-paying stocks and
                        how they are a good fit for most investors. While other investment strategies have gone in and
                        out of style, investing in companies with growing dividends remains a popular choice for
                        investors who are seeking long-term growth with increasing income.

                        Our research is as unique as our firm. Four times a year, our president, Craig Hafer, writes
                        about a topic that is relevant to today’s investors. These newsletters have fans across the
                        county and have earned the accolades of the WEEU radio listening audience, where Craig hosts
                        <span class="is-italic">The Quarterly Report</span> with Craig Hafer. One retired professional
                        investor referred to our newsletters as “reading a good profile in The New Yorker magazine in a
                        subject that I know quite well.”
