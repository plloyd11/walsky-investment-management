                    <p>
                        While protecting the environment provides a greater quality of life, we realize that to have a
                        strong and robust economy, we also need protect our environment. Our Spring, 2017 newsletter,
                        <a href="/dashboard/#environment">The Environmentally-Minded Economist</a>
                        reviewed why protecting the environment is imperative for promoting a stronger economy. As we
                        have long known, protecting the environment is one of the best investments we can make as a
                        society.
