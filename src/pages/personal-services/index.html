                    <h2 class="title">Independence</h2>
                    <p>Our firm is independent. We receive no remuneration of any kind from insurance companies, mutual funds, banks, or brokerage houses. Our clients are likewise independent, and they want to be able to pick the best tax preparer, the best attorney, the best accountant and the best investment advisor that will attend to their special needs. At Walsky Investment Management, Inc. we define personal service as having a one-on-one relationship between the client and the investment professional.</p>
                    <h2 class="has-margin-top-md has-margin-bottom-sm is-size-4">A Clearer Understanding of Portfolio Holdings</h2>
                    <p>Our quarterly statements are easy to read and understand. They show the quantity, cost, market value and projected income for each holding, and can be tailored to meet your specific requirements. For instance, we can combine all the accounts we manage for a household, including regular and retirement accounts. This makes it easier for clients to understand their holdings and how their portfolio is being managed. We would be happy to provide a schedule of our fees upon request.</p>

                <h2>Investment Style</h2>
                <p>At Walsky Investment Management, Inc. our emphasis is investing for the long-term. We realize the importance of dividends which provide earnings to stockholders and at the same time minimizes downside risk. Our clients' portfolios consist mainly of common stocks of companies with consistent dividend growth.</p>
                <p>The remainder is invested in fixed income vehicles such as U.S. government bonds, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and money market funds. We believe that this investment style affords lower risk without lowering the appreciation potential that makes common stocks attractive.</p>

                <h2>How is Walsky different from a mutual fund?</h2>
                <p>Walsky Investment Management, Inc. is a registered investment advisory firm that creates individual portfolios for each client based on his or her needs. A mutual fund, on the other hand, is a portfolio of stocks in which a group of investors mutually invest and receive shares of ownership. In addition, there are thousands of mutual funds whose management can change over time. The fees that mutual funds charge have become a concern of investor groups and investment journals that have noted the fees may be excessive. At Walsky, there is only one fee and the fee is clearly identified to the client.</p>
                <p>The portfolios that we create are diversified and include many sectors of the U.S. large-cap equity market. Each portfolio differs in asset allocation based upon the client's requirements and risk tolerance. By managing each portfolio independently, we ensure that our clients have investments that are appropriate for them.</p>
