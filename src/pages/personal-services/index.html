                    <p>
                        At Walsky Investment Management we believe that every investor should know why they are investing and how they are invested.
                        One size does not fit all and each portfolio should meet the unique needs of every client. Our clients are discerning
                        investors who value the level of service that we provide and the ability to work individually with the professionals that are
                        responsible for managing their portfolio and making the investment decisions. Our quarterly statements are concise and clear
                        and easy to read. We meet regularly with our clients to review their portfolio and to answer any questions that they may have
                        about their portfolio, the economy, or on occasion, about the world in general. It is the exceptional level of service that we
                        call The Walsky Way.

                    <p>
                        Our firm is independent. We receive no remuneration of any kind from insurance companies, mutual funds, banks, or brokerage
                        houses. Our clients are likewise independent, and they want to be able to pick the best tax preparer, the best attorney, the
                        best accountant and the best investment advisor that will attend to their special needs. At Walsky Investment Management, Inc.
                        we define personal service as having a one-on-one relationship between the client and the investment professional.

                    <p>
                        Our quarterly statements are easy to read and understand. They show the quantity, cost, market value and projected income for
                        each holding, and can be tailored to meet your specific requirements. For instance, we can combine all the accounts we manage
                        for a household, including regular and retirement accounts. This makes it easier for clients to understand their holdings and
                        how their portfolio is being managed. We would be happy to provide a schedule of our fees upon request.
